    "Airbnb Inc. is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking.\\\n",

    "Airbnb provides a platform for hosts to accommodate guests with short-term lodging and tourism-related activities. Guests can search for lodging using filters such as lodging type, dates, location, and price. Guests have the ability to search for specific types of homes, such as bed and breakfasts, unique homes, and vacation homes. Before booking, users must provide personal and payment information.Some hosts also require a scan of government-issued identification before accepting a reservation.Guests have the ability to chat with hosts through a secure messaging system.Hosts provide prices and other details for their rental or event listings, such as the allowed number of guests, home type, rules, and amenities. Pricing is determined by the host, with recommendations from Airbnb. Hosts and guests have the ability to leave reviews about the experience.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "In order to choose an apropriate listing price, Airbnb suggests to \"search for comparable listings in your city or neighborhood to get an idea of market prices.\" So, the city or neighborhood, or in other word, the location is one of the determinant component of the price. \n"

By using Foresquare data, I would like to explore the vendors of the neighbourhoods in New York City, in order to find out which neighbourhoods are more expensive and why.
